# Rust resources every learner should know

## Reading Material 📚

**Quick Summaries**

- 👶 [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/) is a step-by-step guide for the Rust programming language. It gives a nice overview of the language and allows the learner to also modify the code examples to experiment.

- 👶 [A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust) is a nice and quick summary that goes over a lot of concepts of the language with quick examples. Everything is on a single webpage page! This resource is also very useful for refreshing quickly on various concepts.

- 👶 [A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/readme.html) is sort of a short book that summarizes the main Rust concepts. The idea, as mentioned by the author, is to "try before you buy" to get to know enough about the language before digging into the more involved resources like "the book".

**🆓 Free Online Books:**

- 👶 [Rust Book "The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): This is the official book on the Rust programming language, written by the Rust development team at the Mozilla Foundation.

- 👶 [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/): Rust by example has a collection of runnable examples for the various concepts in Rust.

- 👶 [Easy Rust](https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/): This is a resource that tries to focus on using "easy English" for learning Rust for non-native speakers of English. The nice thing about this book also is that there is a youtube video linked in the book and associated with each chapter.

- 👴 [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/): This book is written by the awesome Mara Bos and is available for free. As the book's name implies, it talks about Rust atomics and locks. As such, the content of this book is largely relevant for writing concurrent application code. Typically not a beginner feat, however, a must-know resource as you advance your knowledge in Rust.

- 👴 [Rust Design Patterns](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/intro.html): If you want to get into writing more idiomatic Rust this is a good resource. This is not a book to pick up as a beginner for sure but rather when you advance in Rust. If you come from a different language, the book would also help you navigate differences in design patterns. Reading parts of this book actually helped you as you got more into reading other people's codes.

**💲 Paid In-Print Books:**

- 👨 [Rust in Action](https://amzn.to/3DRu0qh): Rust in Action is a great read and offers many examples. The author (Tim Mcnamara) himself also recommends the book to those already familiar with some Rust. The book helped us clarify various concepts in Rust. Finally, on a side note, the author, Tim Mcnamara, also maintains a youtube channel relative to Rust listed in the video section below.

- 👨 [Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development](https://amzn.to/3Jfxbtb): This book is rated as an Amazon bestseller. The book goes into a lot of detail and different ways to do the same things in Rust.

- 👶 [Beginning Rust: From Novice to Professional](https://amzn.to/3DS1pBi): This book to be one of the most digestible books teaching Rust. The nice thing about this book is that its material also ties to practice material on Educative.

- 👴 [Rust for Rustaceans](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans): This is a popular book among advanced users and has great reviews. Jon Gjengset, has a youtube channel that you might absolutely love (more details in video section below).

## YouTube Videos 📹

- 👶 [Rust Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLqEtX6ql2EyPAZ1M2_C0GgVd4A-_L4_5), by Doug Milford was one of my favorite resources. Doug does a great job of explaining a lot of the sticky concepts in Rust. The videos also go over different code examples and scenarios to explain.

- 👶 [CS Honors @ Illinois](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRA18QWPzB7FYVyg0WFKC6g/featured) was another favorite go-to channel to clarify concepts. The series of videos is based on the CS196 (now CS124) freshman course at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign which is run by students. The course videos are not entirely about Rust, however, for the ones that do cover Rust concepts.

- 👶 [Lets Get Rusty](https://www.youtube.com/c/LetsGetRusty/featured) is a useful channel that provides weekly videos about Rust. It has a nice playlist that goes over "the book" chapters one by one.

- 👶 [Rust Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw), by Brad Traversy is a great quick tour that introduces various concepts to the absolute beginner.

- 👶 [Ryan Levick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpeX4D-ArTrsqvhLapAHprQ) is a former Microsoft engineer that works on Rust and has a series of videos with useful explanations for certain concepts. There is also a cool project where Ryan builds an SDK for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 using Rust.

- 👨 [timClicks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClny6qj9Mv7uFo9XGUGYQBA) is a channel by Tim Mcnamara that covers various topics in Rust and also offers live coding streams. Tim is also the author of the Rust in Action book mentioned earlier.

- 👶 [Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsocPEZBd-M&t=1820s) provides a beginner tutorial for Rust that works through a CLI application. Although somewhat useful.

- 👴 [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iD0xppBwwsrM9DegC5cQQ) provides a series of videos about Rust concepts, however, these videos are not really entry-level as they assume a certain level of knowledge. These videos would probably be better when you become more comfortable with Rust concepts. In the videos, Jon would pick up a certain topic in Rust and tackle it from almost every angle. Watch out though, the videos can get very long! Probably nothing less than an hour per video. The longest [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGS-HqcAvA4&t=40s) is at 7 hours and 20 mins long!
